Various STL files for W5500 on GameCube


These were remixed from Silverstee1 SP1ETH 
source: https://github.com/silverstee1/SP1ETH

I made alterations for the W5500 to fit in the SP1ETH, if it is ever supported in the future. 

Currently, W5500  in the SP1 port is not supported as of writing this 6/19/25

Also, included are STL files to make a W5500 SP12SP2-ETH with a SP2 stabilizer. You can use the small PCB from most angled SD2SP2 adapters as long as you wire to the correct pins. The first part has 2 versions but the only difference is the hole going towards the SP2 port.
