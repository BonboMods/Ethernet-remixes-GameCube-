Various STL files for W5500 on GameCube


These were remixed from Silverstee1 SP1ETH 
source: https://github.com/silverstee1/SP1ETH
I made alterations for the W5500 to fit if it is ever supported in the future. 

Currently, W5500  in the SP1 port is not supported. 

Also, included are STL files to make a W5500 SP12SP2-ETH with a SP2 stabilizer.
